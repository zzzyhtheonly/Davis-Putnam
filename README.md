Use the shell script to run the 3 python programs in a single line:
./run.sh inputfile

Inputfile(named whatever you like) is the formatted input for front end, please make it the first parameter of the script.

If you want to see the output for each single program, please edit run.sh and delete the final line.

By the way, solutions are a little bit different from the examples given, but they are true solutions.
